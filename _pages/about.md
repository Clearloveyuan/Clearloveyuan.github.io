Hello, I am Dongyuan Li (李东远). I am currently an Assistant Professor in The University of Tokyo, advised by Prof. [Renhe Jiang](https://www.renhejiang.com/).
And I am also a Research Fellow in Science Tokyo. I have obtained my Ph.D in the [Okumura-Funakoshi Lab](https://lr-www.pi.titech.ac.jp/wp/), Department of Information and Communication Engineering at [Tokyo Institute of Technology](https://www.first.iir.titech.ac.jp/), advised by Prof. [Satoshi Kosugi](https://satoshi-kosugi.github.io/index.html), Prof. [Funakoshi Kotaro](http://lr-www.pi.titech.ac.jp/~funakoshi/public/en/) and Prof. [Okumura Manabu](http://www.lr.pi.titech.ac.jp/~oku/index-j.html). My research interests lie in Machine Learning, Social Network Analysis and Natural Language Generation.

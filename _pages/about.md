Hello, I am Dongyuan Li (李东远). I am a second year Ph.D. student in the [Okumura-Funakoshi Lab](https://lr-www.pi.titech.ac.jp/wp/), Department of Information and Communication Engineering at [Tokyo Institute of Technology](https://www.first.iir.titech.ac.jp/), advised by Prof. [Funakoshi Kotaro](http://lr-www.pi.titech.ac.jp/~funakoshi/public/en/) and Prof. [Okumura Manabu](http://www.lr.pi.titech.ac.jp/~oku/index-j.html). My research interests lie in Machine Learning, Social Network Analysis and Natural Language Generation. 

My favoriate words:

Do not worry about your problems with mathematics, I assure you mine are far greater. --- From Albert Einstein
